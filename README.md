# ab_testing

This dataset has 294,478 rows and 5 columns. The author of the dataset does not specify the research methods.
I assume the participants are randomly assigned to two groups: the old web page (control) and the new web page (treatment). 
A chi-square test of independence is used to compare types of web pages and whether consumers would convert. 
Results indicate there is no difference in conversion between people who see the old web page and people who see the new web page.
